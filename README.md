#Project Giphy

##This app was developed to query Giphy's API with search parameters inputted by the user.

##I decided that the project required two major components: Search.js; GifsLoader.js.

[1)] Search.js is the most complex of the components, where axios calls are made to the giphy API based on user input, number of gifs shown, and maturity ratings.

[2)] GifsLoader.js utilizes the Material UI, specifically GridList & GridTile, to make a three column display, with the row amount determined by the user in Search.js. This the gifs to take up the maximum amount of space alloted on the screen.

##Testing was done via ______. 

##This web app is deployed on ______. Please take a look!
